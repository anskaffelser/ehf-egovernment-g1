= Criterion information

In the request you can ask for supporting documents based on a criteria from the Criteria Taxonomy, both the UUID and/or the criteria type code can be used. Request can also be based on a criteria group or a criteria property. Basic open data about the economic operator can also be requested, without referring to a criteria.

Please note that to request supporting documents at criteria group or property level, the UUID from the Criteria Taxonomy must be used at the appropriate level.
